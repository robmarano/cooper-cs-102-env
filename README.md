# CS 102 M - Course Notes
Fall 2022
The Cooper Union
Prof Rob Marano

## Getting Started with your CUCC Linux Environment

We will be using Ubuntu Server 20 for our class this semester, working on a single type of development environment for C and for Python 3. The server is cs102.cooper.edu (10.41.17.105) as wifi and the academic vlan are separated. You will need to connect to the academicvpn before they can ssh into this serer.

Please confirm you have received and understand the email that Jacob Koziej sent on August 12, 2022. He describes how you can connect to the server.
